# Identity Management & Access Control

## Mechanisms for Authentication

### Single Sign-On (SSO) 
* single login into system
* centralized data store with users or access server
* using protocols such as LDAP or Kerberos

### Federated Identity
* SSO on many organizations level
* set of standards for exchange of identity
* user does not login into the application directly. He is redirected to IdM (Identity management system)

### Kerberos
* it is a protocol used for Authentication and Authorization
* main purpose is NOT to send user password anywhere (for authentication request to KDC server hash of the password is being sent)
* it is an SSO mechanism where user logs in only once
* based on trusted 3rd side
* its a mutual authentication mechanism. Bots user and the service to which users log in must prove they are valid

#### Based on 3A principle
* Authentication
* Authorization
* Auditing

#### Components of Kerberos
* KDC (Key Distribution Centre) which contains:
* AS (Authentication Server)
* TGS (Ticket Granting Server)
* Principal that represent the user of the system
* Service (server the system contacts with)
* Realm (Domain) e.g. DEVELOPER.COM
* Principal (User) e.g. arek@DEVELOPER.COM, host/java.developer.com@DEVELOPER.COM

#### Cons of Kerberos
* constant availability of KDC
* sensitive to time synchronization issues
* in case of TGS hash breach. Attacker can act as any user in the system.
