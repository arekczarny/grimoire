# Microservices

## Definition
Microservices quick description of characteristics:
* implementing SOA pattern
* through Microservices you eliminate central points \(of failure ESB\) 
* you ensure loose coupling of components
* cloud native solution 

**Disadvantages**
* freedom to select any technology for implementation. Too many different tech stacks might lead to total chaos
* high technological complexity of the solutions based on Microservices
* very complicated infrastructure and its management
* much harder analysis of communication flows \(harder than in e.g. Monolith), additional patterns, tools required to
make some sensible observation of Microservices communication 

**When**
* autonomy is the must have
* team\(s\) have required experience to work with selected technology stack and set of tools for the job
* big need for fast and high scalability of the system being build \(already in production\)
