# Architecture Done Right

## Architecture Drivers
Architecture Drivers direct us to make concrete Software Architecture decisions. Those drivers are being described 
by specific Classes described below.

### Classes of Architecture Drivers


### Local Architecture Drivers
Those Drivers would be considered per e.g. Bounded Context. They would be one of the Classes described above but
local to a specific BC instead of the whole system.
This also implies that specific Architecture decision can be specific to a local Bounded Context instead of the whole
solution e.g. if we decided that we will use MVC design pattern for one sub system then it is *not* mandatory for 
all our BCs to be build based on the MVC layers. We can use a different design patter that solves our problem in
different BC.

Organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication
structures of these organizations - M. Conway

Make sure that we preserve Bounded Contexts created via specific team setup (one team per BC) or by preserving the 
boundaries of BC in case different teams are required to work on different BCs (this can be achieved by automatic,
programmatic use of software tools e.g. Maven modules).
